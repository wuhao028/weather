### Introduction

- This is a demo weather App using open weather map api.
- This app is based on MVP pattern and retrofit
- As a limited time, I've only written the unit test for Util.class, the report is under weather/report/index.html,
coverage is more than 80%.
- an Apk is under root directory ready to install

### Features :
- Showing cities' weather and fives days weather forecast
- Displaying icons
- City search and show the weather of search result
- Pull to refresh weather
- Animation for the wind image
- Sticky header animation
- Using the phoneâ€™s location to detect the default city
- Setting the windwindowBackground for MainActivity makes the loading more smooth

### Improvements need to do:
- optimize the error page including network error and data error page etc.
- write more unit tests
- add city management, allow the user to add and delete cities.
- store the data in the local device
- test on more different size screens
